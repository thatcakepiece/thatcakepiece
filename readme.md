I'm thatcakepiece, a 17-year-old with an obsession for computers.

I've always been fascinated by technology and spent most of my free time exploring new software and gadgets. Sometimes, I can be found tinkering with code, in the meantime I also like doing photography.

My first experiences of programming came from [Sketchware](https://sketchware-docs.vercel.app/) at the age of 13. I'm constantly seeking to learn new things and to improve my skills. To get to know more about my journey visit my social media or website.
